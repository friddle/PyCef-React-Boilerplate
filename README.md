## PyCef-React-Boilerplate

use cefpython and React tools for desktop environment

### Why
Because I hate the js as backend language. The so many library force use async and callback.
 the only matter callback should only be used in front UI update.    
the callback and async made the system is hard to debug and track. and js is not ok for organize 
for backend language.
